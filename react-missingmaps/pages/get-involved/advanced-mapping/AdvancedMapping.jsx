      <p>
        JOSM is a powerful OpenStreetMap editing tool that will supercharge your
        mapping abilities! We recommend that mappers who want to take their
        mapping to the next level progress to using this tool. First, you’ll
        need to download the application. You can do that{' '}
        <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Download">here</a>. This
        application is available for both Macs and PCs. Compared to iD Editor,
        the setup process can be no picnic, so give yourself time to navigate
        this new tool before you plan to jump into your mapping. Once you are
        using JOSM you’ll never look back!
