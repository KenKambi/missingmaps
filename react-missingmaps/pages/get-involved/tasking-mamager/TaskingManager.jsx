      <h3>Step 1 - Start Mapping</h3>
      <p>
        It is no problem if you have never mapped before. It doesn’t take long
        to learn - just about an afternoon! If you already know how to edit
        OpenStreetMap (OSM), feel free to just get started. If you’re new to
        mapping, we recommend you keep reading, and watch the videos below to
        get set up. If you’ve mapped before, consider learning to validate.
        There are also additional tutorials available on LearnOSM.
