          With your mobile phone (and soon to be web app!), you can play a part
          in helping communities around the world, one swipe at a time. Around
          the world, millions of individuals are affected by disasters, disease,
          and conflict. First responders working with these communities often
          have to cover large areas, but lack the data necessary for an
          efficient, effective response. Through MapSwipe, volunteers pinpoint
          where critical infrastructure and populations are located, allowing
          mappers to focus only on areas where they know features need to be
          mapped. MapSwipe is an open-source mobile app that is making mapping
          around the world more coordinated and efficient. Volunteers swipe
          through satellite images looking for features (ie: buildings,
          roadways, waterways, etc.) and tap once when they have located them.
          Each set of imagery is viewed by at least three different individuals
          to create a mechanism for internal validation of results. We believe
          that anyone, anywhere should be able to contribute to the Missing Maps
          project.

        <h2>How To Use MapSwipe</h2>
        <p>
          MapSwipe is very intuitive. Mappers follow these steps: <br />
          <ol>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>

          </ol>
          Since its start in 2015, MapSwipe has scaled to 29,000 users mapping 600,000 km2 (larger than the area of Kenya). MapSwipe is volunteer-driven and community-led. Any organization or mapping community can request to use MapSwipe to help with their activities on the ground. To learn more check out the MapSwipe website.
